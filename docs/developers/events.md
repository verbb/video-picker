# Events
Video Picker provides a collection of events for extending its functionality. Modules and plugins can register event listeners, typically in their `init()` methods, to modify Video Pickerâ€™s behavior.

## Source Events

### The `beforeSaveSource` event
The event that is triggered before a source is saved.

```php
use verbb\videopicker\events\SourceEvent;
use verbb\videopicker\services\Sources;
use yii\base\Event;

Event::on(Sources::class, Sources::EVENT_BEFORE_SAVE_SOURCE, function(SourceEvent $event) {
    $source = $event->source;
    $isNew = $event->isNew;
    // ...
});
```

### The `afterSaveSource` event
The event that is triggered after a source is saved.

```php
use verbb\videopicker\events\SourceEvent;
use verbb\videopicker\services\Sources;
use yii\base\Event;

Event::on(Sources::class, Sources::EVENT_AFTER_SAVE_SOURCE, function(SourceEvent $event) {
    $source = $event->source;
    $isNew = $event->isNew;
    // ...
});
```

### The `beforeDeleteSource` event
The event that is triggered before a source is deleted.

```php
use verbb\videopicker\events\SourceEvent;
use verbb\videopicker\services\Sources;
use yii\base\Event;

Event::on(Sources::class, Sources::EVENT_BEFORE_DELETE_SOURCE, function(SourceEvent $event) {
    $source = $event->source;
    // ...
});
```

### The `afterDeleteSource` event
The event that is triggered after a source is deleted.

```php
use verbb\videopicker\events\SourceEvent;
use verbb\videopicker\services\Sources;
use yii\base\Event;

Event::on(Sources::class, Sources::EVENT_AFTER_DELETE_SOURCE, function(SourceEvent $event) {
    $source = $event->source;
    // ...
